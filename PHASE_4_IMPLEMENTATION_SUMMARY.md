## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS RESOLVED**

### **Environment Issues (FIXED)**
1. **Python Path Problem:** 
   - Issue: `zsh: command not found: python`
   - Solution: ✅ Setup script uses `python3` consistently
   
2. **Port Conflicts:**
   - Issue: Backend port 8000 already in use
   - Solution: ✅ Auto-detection of available ports
   
3. **Database Backup:**
   - Issue: Risk of data loss during schema changes
   - Solution: ✅ Automated backup creation

### **Setup Script Features**
- ✅ Automatic Python detection (`python3` vs `python`)
- ✅ Port conflict resolution with auto-detection
- ✅ Database backup with timestamp
- ✅ Convenient startup scripts (`./start_dev.sh`)
- ✅ Environment configuration management
