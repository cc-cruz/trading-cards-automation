# 🚀 FlipHero Launch Checklist

## Pre-Launch Status ✅

### ✅ Backend Health
- [x] Service-account authentication working
- [x] Signed upload URLs generating correctly  
- [x] Import issues resolved (Python 3.9 compatibility)
- [x] OCR pipeline functional (needs refinement but working)
- [x] Hybrid pricing system operational

### ✅ Core User Flow (Option B)
1. **User uploads image**: Frontend → `/api/v1/uploads/signed-url` → Gets upload URL
2. **Direct GCS upload**: Frontend → PUT to signed URL → Image stored in `fliphero-cards-bucket/cards/`
3. **Process card**: Frontend → `/api/v1/cards/process-url` → OCR + pricing + database storage
4. **Export for eBay**: `/api/v1/collections/{id}/export` → CSV with GCS image URLs

## 🔧 Known Issues & Mitigations

### OCR Parser Refinement Needed
- **Issue**: Set extraction sometimes captures too much text
- **Current**: `"set": "Topps Chrome Paul Skenes #124 Rc Rookie"` 
- **Expected**: `"set": "Topps Chrome"`
- **Mitigation**: Manual edit UI for confidence < 80%

### Confidence Scoring
```python
# Current logic in enhanced_card_processor.py
required_fields = ['player', 'set', 'year']
found_fields = [k for k in required_fields if result.get(k)]
confidence = len(found_fields) / len(required_fields)
if result.get('parallel') or result.get('features'):
    confidence = min(1.0, confidence + 0.2)
```

## 🎯 MVP Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Guided Onboarding (Today)
1. **Manual oversight**: Review each card before users export
2. **Feature flag**: Enable "edit card details" modal for low-confidence results
3. **User education**: "Some fields may need manual review"

### Phase 2: Rapid Iteration (Next 7 days)
1. **Log OCR misses**: Capture raw OCR text + user corrections
2. **Pattern improvement**: Update regex based on real user data
3. **Confidence tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on user feedback

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Criteria

### ✅ GREEN LIGHTS
- Backend starts without errors
- Signed upload flow works end-to-end  
- OCR extracts at least player name + one other field
- CSV export includes valid GCS image URLs
- Pricing returns non-zero estimates

### ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE RISKS  
- Set field occasionally too verbose → user can edit
- Card numbers sometimes missed → user can add
- Parallel detection inconsistent → pricing still works

### 🛑 RED LIGHTS (None currently)
- Authentication failures
- Image upload failures  
- Complete OCR failures
- Database crashes

## 📋 User Onboarding Script

### Setup (5 minutes)
1. Create account
2. Create first collection: "My Cards"
3. Upload one test image
4. Review extracted data
5. Export sample CSV

### Success Metrics
- User can upload image ✅
- At least 2/3 fields extracted correctly ✅  
- Price estimate appears ✅
- CSV downloads with image URL ✅

## 🔥 Emergency Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:
1. **Disable OCR**: Return to manual entry mode
2. **Local storage fallback**: Switch from GCS to local images
3. **Static pricing**: Use fixed $5-$50 estimates

## 🎯 Next 48 Hours Priority

1. **Monitor user sessions**: Watch for common failure patterns
2. **Collect feedback**: What fields do users most often correct?
3. **Quick wins**: Fix the most frequent OCR patterns
4. **Scale preparation**: Add error monitoring & alerts

## ⚡ Ready to Launch

**Recommendation**: PROCEED with guided onboarding. The core flow works, OCR extracts useful data (even if imperfect), and users can manually correct issues. This is a classic MVP - working software with known limitations that you'll improve based on real user feedback.

**Key message to users**: "FlipHero automatically extracts card details using AI. Please review and edit any fields that look incorrect before exporting."
