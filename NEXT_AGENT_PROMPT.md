# 🎯 Next Agent Session Prompt - Phase 3: Core Features

## 📋 **Context & Current Status**
You are continuing development of FlipHero, a trading card automation MVP. **Phase 1 (Backend)** and **Phase 2 (Frontend Integration)** are complete with working authentication flow.

**Current State:**
- ✅ FastAPI backend running at http://localhost:8000 with full authentication
- ✅ Next.js frontend running at http://localhost:3000 with working auth flow
- ✅ SQLite database with proper schema (User, Card, Collection, CardImage models)
- ✅ Complete frontend-backend integration tested and verified
- ✅ Git commit 87a1acf contains all Phase 2 work

## 🎯 **Your Mission: Phase 3 - Core Features**

### **Priority 1: Card Upload & Processing System**

**Goal:** Create a complete card upload and processing workflow

**Tasks:**
1. **Build Image Upload Component**
   - Create drag & drop interface in `/src/pages/dashboard/upload.tsx`
   - Support multiple file uploads with image preview
   - Add progress indicators and file validation
   - Integrate with existing FastAPI upload endpoint

2. **Connect OCR Processing**
   - Integrate `src/utils/enhanced_card_processor.py` with the upload flow
   - Create API endpoint to process uploaded images with OCR
   - Display extracted card data with manual edit capabilities
   - Add card data validation and confirmation flow

3. **Collection Management**
   - Create collection creation/editing interface
   - Add collection selector to upload flow
   - Implement collection organization and card assignment
   - Update dashboard stats to reflect new cards

**Existing Code to Integrate:**
- OCR processing: `src/utils/enhanced_card_processor.py`
- Card models: `src/models/card.py` 
- Card service: `src/services/card_service.py` (has placeholder upload method)

### **Priority 2: Price Research Integration**

**Goal:** Connect existing price research with the card processing flow

**Tasks:**
1. **Price API Integration**
   - Connect `src/utils/price_finder.py` to card processing
   - Create price research endpoint that triggers automatically after OCR
   - Display pricing data in card details view
   - Add manual price refresh capability

2. **Price Display & Analytics**
   - Show current market value on card cards
   - Create price history tracking
   - Update collection value calculations in dashboard stats

**Existing Code to Integrate:**
- Price research: `src/utils/price_finder.py`
- Price service: `src/services/price_service.py`

## 🛠 **Technical Guidelines**

### **Development Environment**
- Backend: `python3 server.py` (starts FastAPI at :8000)
- Frontend: `npm run dev` (starts Next.js at :3000)
- Database: SQLite file `carddealer.db` (already created)

### **Architecture Patterns to Follow**
- **Backend:** Service layer pattern (see existing services)
- **Frontend:** Component-based with TypeScript
- **State:** Use existing AuthContext pattern for any new global state
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (see existing components for patterns)
- **API:** RESTful endpoints following existing pattern

### **Key Integration Points**
- `src/services/card_service.py` - Add your upload processing logic here
- `src/main.py` - Add new API endpoints here
- `src/pages/dashboard/` - Add new frontend pages here
- `src/components/` - Create reusable UI components here

## 🧪 **Testing Requirements**
- Test complete upload → OCR → price research → save flow
- Verify collection management works with existing auth
- Ensure new features work with existing dashboard
- Test error handling and user feedback

## 📋 **Deliverables**
1. **Working card upload interface** with drag & drop
2. **OCR integration** that extracts card data from images
3. **Collection management** for organizing cards
4. **Price research integration** showing market values
5. **Updated dashboard** reflecting new cards and pricing

## 🚀 **Getting Started**
1. Check current status: both servers should already be running
2. Test existing auth flow: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
3. Examine existing code structure in `/src`
4. Start with creating the upload page: `/src/pages/dashboard/upload.tsx`
5. Build incrementally and test each feature as you go

## 💡 **Success Criteria**
- Users can upload card images and see extracted data
- OCR processing works automatically on upload
- Cards are properly saved to collections with pricing data
- Dashboard stats update to reflect new cards
- All functionality works within existing authentication system

**Remember:** The goal is a working MVP where users can upload cards, extract data via OCR, get pricing, and manage their collection. Focus on core functionality over advanced features.

Good luck building the core features! 🃏
